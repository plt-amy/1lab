# Partially ordered sets

A **poset** (short for **p**artially **o**rdered set) is a \r{set}
equipped with a relation $x \le y$ which is reflexive, transitive and
antisymmetric. Put another way, a poset is a [univalent] \r{category}
having at most one morphism between each pair of elements.

For convenience reasons, we prefer _not_ to work with the category
generated by a poset: the category associated with a poset reifies a lot
of _redundant_ information, which is necessary when working with
$\hom$-sets, but not with $\hom$-props. Working with the generated
category is analogous to only ever working with locally discrete
bicategories: you _could_, but then you'd be hauling around a bunch of
redundant information.

Another reason to define posets as their own concept, rather than as a
special case of categories, is using our pre-existing infrastructure for
constructing very convenient categories of sets-with-structure; In this
case, sets with "po" structure!

We start by defining the _predicate_ `is-partial-order`{.Agda} on a
relation $x \le y$. That it turns out to be a predicate is actually
slightly nontrivial: The first four components are manifestly
propositional, but the last component --- the witness of antisymmetry
--- could really gunk things up, since it has the potential to assign
loops! But, given any antisymmetric relation $x \le y$, the family

$$
(x, y) \mapsto (x \le y) \land (y \le x)
$$

is an identity system^[Together with the unique evidence that this is a
reflexive relation] on $A$; and, being a product of propositions, it's
also a proposition, so $A$ is automatically a set.

```agda

A po structure on a set --- okay, that joke _is_ getting old --- is
given by tupling together the relation $x \le y$ together with a proof
that it is a partial order relation. Identity of poset structures is
thus determined by identity _of the relations_, since being a partial
order is a proposition.

```agda
record Poset-on {ℓ} ℓ′ (A : Type ℓ) : Type (ℓ ⊔ lsuc ℓ′) where
  no-eta-equality

```

We set up the category of posets using our [machinery for displaying]
[univalent categories] over the category of sets. A map between posets
is called a **monotone map**: it's the decategorification of a functor.
We don't need preservation of identities _or_ preservation of
composites, since our "homs" are propositions!

```agda
Poset-structure : ∀ ℓ ℓ′ → Thin-structure {ℓ = ℓ} (ℓ ⊔ ℓ′) (Poset-on ℓ′)
∣ Poset-structure ℓ ℓ′ .is-hom f P Q ∣ =
  ∀ x y → Poset-on._≤_ P x y → Poset-on._≤_ Q (f x) (f y)

Poset-structure ℓ ℓ′ .is-hom f P Q .is-tr =
  Π-is-hlevel³ 1 λ _ _ _ → Poset-on.≤-thin Q

Poset-structure ℓ ℓ′ .id-is-hom x y α = α
Poset-structure ℓ ℓ′ .∘-is-hom f g α β x y γ = α (g x) (g y) (β x y γ)
```

The last thing we have to prove is "uniqueness of identity maps": If we
have the identity being a monotone map $(a, t) \to (a, s)$ _and_ $(a, s)
\to (a, t)$ --- that is, we have $(x \le_s y) \leftrightarrow (x \le_t
y)$ --- then, by propositional extensionality, we have $\le_s = \le_t$.
Then, since equality of poset structures is controlled by equality of
the relations, we have $s = t$!

The relationship between posets and (strict) categories is outlined in
the module [`Cat.Order.Cat`](Cat.Order.Cat.html). Very similarly to
categories, posets have a duality involution. In fact, under the
correspondence between posets and thin categories, these are the same
construction.
