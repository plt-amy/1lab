# Closures of relations

A **closure operator** $-^{+}$ on relations takes a relation $R$ on a type
$A$ to a new relation $R^{+}$ on $A$, where $R^{+}$ is the smallest
relation containing $R$ that satisfies some property.

Intuitively, the closure of a relation should enjoy the following properties:
- If $R \subseteq S$, then $R^{+} \subseteq S^{+}$.
- $R \subseteq R^{+}$
- $(R^{+})^{+} \subseteq R^{+}$, as closing $R$ under a property twice shouldn't
  add any more elements.

This ends up forming a [monad], though we do not define a closure operator as
such due to annoying size restrictions.

[monad]: Cat.Diagram.Monad.html

```agda
record is-rel-closure
  (K : ∀ {ℓ ℓ'} {A : Type ℓ} → Rel A A ℓ' → Rel A A (ℓ ⊔ ℓ'))
  : Typeω where
  field
    monotone : R ⊆r S → K R ⊆r K S
    extensive : R ⊆r K R
    closed : K (K R) ⊆r K R
    has-prop : is-prop-rel (K R)
```

Closure, monotonicity, and extensivity combine to give idempotence
of the closure operator.

```agda
  idempotent : K (K R) ≡ K R
  idempotent =
    prop-rel-ext has-prop has-prop
      closed
      (monotone extensive)
```

We can also derive an extension operator using the normal formulation
for monads.

```agda
  extend : S ⊆r K R → K S ⊆r K R
  extend p kr = closed (monotone p kr)
```

We can leverage this to see that if $R \subseteq S \subseteq K R$, then
$K R = K S$.

```agda
  ⊆+⊆-clo→≃ : S ⊆r R → R ⊆r K S → K R ≃r K S
  ⊆+⊆-clo→≃ p q =
    prop-ext has-prop has-prop  (extend q) (monotone p)
```
