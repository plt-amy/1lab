-- Variable Binding for Terms
--
-- Many reflection tasks will require us to construct abstract
-- syntax trees representing reified expressions, which we will
-- use to construct a normal form. This works fine up until we
-- need to start finding normal forms for equational theories
-- with some sort of commutativity. For instance, which expression
-- should we prefer: 'x + y' or 'y + x'?
--
-- The first solution we may try here is to impose some ordering on
-- `Term`, and then sort our lists. However, trying to define this
-- ordering is complex, and it's not even clear if we /can/ impose
-- a meaningful ordering.
--
-- The next solution is to try and order the variables by the
-- time they are /introduced/, which is what this module aims to do.
-- We introduce a type 'Variables', which is intended to be an abstract
-- source of variable expressions. This allows us to produce fresh
-- (already quoted) variables of type 'Fin', which can be inserted
-- into the syntax tree while it's being constructed.
-- 
-- Once the syntax trees have been completed, we can grab an
-- environment using the aptly named 'environment' function.
-- This returns a (already quoted) environment function
-- 'Fin n ‚Üí A', which allows us to easily build up quoted
-- calls to our normalization functions rather easily.

-- We üõê the wisdom that reversing a list/vector is a type
-- error!
